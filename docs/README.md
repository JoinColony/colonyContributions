# Introduction
Welcome to the Colony Contribute repo where non-developers can get paid for contributing to the Colony project. (Developers: check out our Colony Network repo.)

There are two ways to contribute:

1. Work on open tasks and be rewarded
2. Suggest new tasks to be worked on and be rewarded if it’s selected

Below we’ll discuss both.

If you’re going to be contributing, make sure to read our Contribution Guidelines and follow our best practices.

## On using Gitcoin to fund issues and reward contributors
We have a profile page on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co). We’ll be using their tools to: 

1. Surface new issues
2. Fund issues in our repo
3. Allow community members to “Claim” an issue
4. Payout for completed work

See [this tutorial](https://gitcoin.co/help/dev) on how to use Gitcion.

# Workflow
**Overview**
1. New issue is added
  1. As a suggestion by the community (discussed [below](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyContributions/blob/master/docs/README.md#suggesting-an-issue))
  2. As an issue by the core team
2. Issue is funded using Gitcoin
	1. Gitcoin bot will add a comment saying it’s been funded
	2. You can make comments in the issue if you have questions or ideas
3. Contributor clicks the button `Start work` on Gitcoin 
4. Do the work
5. Submit the work on Gitcoin
	1. Colony will review, and if incomplete will ask for revisions
6. Colony accepts the work and payment is sent to the worker

## Claiming an issue
The common workflow is to have a core member add a new issue and fund it through Gitcoin. As a contributor, you can `Start Work` on that issue in Gitcoin.

Communication will happen in comments on the issue in GitHub. Each issue will have a core member assigned to it. The core member will be the person assigned to the issue on GitHub and they’ll be the main point of contact. 

To find already funded issues:

1. Find through [our Gitcoin profile page](https://gitcoin.co/profile/joincolony)
2. Find [issues in GitHub](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonycontributions/issues) that have been funded 

### Submitting completed work
Submitting work will happen through the Gitcoin platform. See their docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8BLKJF7J5RbrfFw-mX0iYcy4VSc6-a1aQXtKT_ta0Y/edit#heading=h.mzjvbspfr2xt) for how to do that. 

In addition to submitting through GitHub, we encourage you to make a new comment on GitHub and @mention the core member letting them know you’ve submitted your work.

### Reviewing the work
After the work has been submitted, the core member assigned to the issue will review it and either ask for revisions or will `Accept` the work on Gitcoin.

### Receiving Payment
Once the work has been reviewed and `Accepted`, the reward will be sent to the worker through the Gitcoin platform. You’ll be notified by email and the Gitcoin bot will post a comment in the GitHub issue.

## Suggesting an issue
We want to encourage community members to suggest new issues—ideas, improvements, bugs, etc—for Colony to work on. If this turns out to be a good idea—as decided by the core team, or by popular opinion in the community—then a core member will fund it and you’ll be rewarded.

A reward for submitting a good idea that ends up getting funded will earn the submitter 10 DAI. This will be paid out using [Gitcoin’s Tip tool](https://gitcoin.co/tip).

When submitting new issues, fill out the Issue Template as best as you can. If it’s an incomplete submission or if it does not make sense, it will be deleted. 

### How to submit a new issue
1. Use the [GitHub Issue tracker](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyContributions/issues/new)
2. Fill in the issue template with as much detail as possible
